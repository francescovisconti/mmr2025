    "text": "Many researchers are trained in the use of one primary method. Using an innovative method may require them to reach out across their own methods of comfort zone, to think outside their normal everyday methods routine. The course on mixed methods will introduce the students into a rather new set of research methods.\nA mixed method research (MMR) is a research program in which methods of different types (qualitative and quantitative) are combined to provide a richer set of insights about the phenomenon under exam (including its context) and to reach greater confidence in the conclusions generated by the research."
